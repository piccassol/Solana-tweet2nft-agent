# Solana-tweet2nft-agent
This is an AI agent that takes a tweet ID as input, fetches the image from the tweet (assuming it's a photo), downloads it, uploads the image and metadata to IPFS (assuming a local IPFS node is running), and mints it as an NFT on Solana's devnet using the Metaplex Token Metadata program.
